# The Binding of Isaac: Parousia: A Tabletop Roguelike
## Executive Summary
 - Tabletop roguelike inspired by the _Binding of Isaac_ series
 - Fast-paced gameplay
 - Many unique collectible items which drastically affect gameplay
 - Many unique characters with unique abilities
 - Play alone or cooperatively without the need of a "DM"
## Game Overview
### High Concept
_The Binding of Isaac_ played with cards and dice.
Player characters escape human sacrifice by fleeing into their basement. There, they find horrible monsters, powerful artifacts, and the devil himself. Players journey deeper and deeper until they meet their eventual deaths. There is no winning and there is no end.
### Genre
Roguelike. For those who don't know what a roguelike is; it is a game, inspired by the original Rogue, characterized by randomly-generated level design which is recreated every time the game is played. Most roguelikes also have some sort of stat system which tracks the characters' abilities which can be upgraded with collectible items. These items themselves can either be randomly generated, or randomly selected from a pool of pre-created items. Roguelikes typically have a very light narrative, and allow the player to choose their own path as they play.
### Hooks
 - gameplay inspired by the popular _Binding of Isaac_ video game series
 - fast-paced gameplay especially for a tabletop game
 - a game that changes and presents a unique experience every time the game is played
 - can be played with materials most tabletop or card gamers will already own, or can easily print out (Solitaire deck, Tarot deck, several D20s, character sheet)
 - huge potential for expansions, whether official or third-party (players can add new items, monsters, bosses, characters to change the game however they like)
### Revenue Model
Sold as a pre-packaged bundle with character sheets, dice, item/enemy/boss decks, and custom art for the solitaire and tarot decks (pickup deck).
### License
This game uses characters and other IP from the _Binding of Isaac_ series, so existing fans of the series should recognize the game from its titular character Isaac on the box art. The gameplay, while offering a new and different experience, is inspired by the fast-paced and diverse gameplay the video game series is known for.
### Gameplay Highlights
 - Huge index of collectible items which alter gameplay drastically
 - Many enemies and bosses to fight
 - Many playable characters offer a different approach to the early stages of the game
 - Simple, fast-paced combat phase
 - Most game elements are determined randomly from card draw and die roll
 - Every new game provides a fresh experience

### Development Team
Myself, Gerald Gerst (Rett). I have never designed a game before.

## Game World
### Backstory
Isaac is a young boy who lives with his mother. One day his mother believes she has heard the voice of God asking her to sacrifice her son to prove her devotion to God. Isaac flees into the basement, where he finds many monsters, bosses and eventually kills his own mom.
### Objective
There is no "win" state, or end. The objective is to continue as long as possible.
### Characters
 - Isaac: main character, also a boss, although it's possible to not play as or encounter him
	 - Well-rounded character, starts with the D6 which can re-roll items
 - Mom: main antagonist, although it is possible to not encounter her
 - Other bosses (Monstro, Larry Jr., the harbingers/horsemen, Little Horn, Satan, etc.)
 - Other playable characters (Azazel, Samson, Apollyon, The Lost, Eve, etc.)
### Mission or Story Progression
There is no "mission" or "end" goal or "win" state although players may decide for themselves to stop after killing a certain boss, getting a certain item, or finishing a certain number of floors. Otherwise, the game just continues infinitely.
The main atomic unit of progression is "floors". Players can progress to the next floor after killing a boss (although they may choose to do other things on the floor before they leave). Progressing to the next floor reshuffles the room deck and scales the difficulty. Enemies and bosses' stats can be mathematic equations like "(floor * 2) + 3" so that the game automatically scales difficulty as the player progresses.
